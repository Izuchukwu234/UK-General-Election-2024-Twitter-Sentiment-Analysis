# UK-General-Election-2024-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
In this my personal project, I will be scrapping 1000 tweets via the hashtag #ConservativeParty which gives me the most recent tweets about the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. This will guide me to know peoples opinion about the performance of the current sitting UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ahead of the general elections which is not suppose to be held pass 25th of January 2025.

Here, I will be using an open source Twitter/X viewer library called Nitter which was gotten from ntscrapper module to fetch raw 1000 tweets made recently based on the hashtag #ConservativeParty. After fetching, they will be processed and converted to a dataframe where Sentiment Analysis can be applied efficiently.
